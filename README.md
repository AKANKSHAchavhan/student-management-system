A Spring Boot REST API application for managing students and courses, built using a clean **6-layer architecture** and **DTO-based design** following industry best practices.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates backend development using **Java 21**, **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **MySQL**. It follows a structured architecture with clear separation between Controller, Service, Repository, DTO, and Entity layers.

The application provides complete **CRUD functionality** for managing students and courses through RESTful APIs — designed to reflect real-world, production-style project organisation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Java 21 | Core language |
| Spring Boot | Application framework |
| Spring Data JPA | Data access abstraction |
| Hibernate ORM | ORM & database mapping |
| MySQL | Relational database |
| Maven | Build & dependency management |
| Postman | API testing |

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The application follows a **6-layer architecture**:

```
src/main/java/com/Akanksha/Student_management/
│
├── controller/        → Handles HTTP requests and API responses
├── service/           → Defines business operations (interfaces)
├── serviceImpl/       → Implements business logic
├── repository/        → Database operations using Spring Data JPA
├── dto/               → Data Transfer Objects (request/response)
└── entity/            → JPA entities mapped to database tables
```

This separation of concerns improves **maintainability**, **scalability**, and **testability**.
